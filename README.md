# C-Learning
This is an explanation from what I've learned, or at least that 
should be, about how works C like the syntax, data types, functions, 
memory, etc.

## How it works?
In `src` you will find c files where there is the explanation of
each theory. 

All the information is in files as comments.

It's easy to identify which theory you want to see or learn 
because I've given each one a descriptive name.

## A bit of theory
If you want to test any file, you need to compile it before you run it.
I use `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) for compile them.

If you use `gcc` to compile them, will appear a file like `a.out` for
default. If you want to assign a name to the output try something like this.

> If you're on Windows the output will be NAME.exe where NAME it's the
> output name you gave it

```
gcc your_file.c -o the_name_you_want
```

I hope this is userful for you.
